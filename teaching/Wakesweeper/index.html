    1. Double click to reveal the number of mines around one cell which you believe is not a mine.
    2. Click once to set a flag to signal the cell which you think is a mine.
    3. If you double click on the mine, a random question will be popped up.
    4. Answer the question correctly, and you can keep playing!
